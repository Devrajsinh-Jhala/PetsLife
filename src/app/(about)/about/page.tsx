          Hello there! Welcome to the{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">PetsLife</span> platfom. I started working
          on this platform when I got the idea to make something interesting in
          this area. As a pet owner, during the initial days, I used to search
          lots and lots of material online to learn how to take care of my pet
          in the best way possible.

        <p className="text-center max-w-[900px]">
          {" "}
          I remember many a times I used to get confused due to availability of
          too much resources. Now having spent 2 beautiful years and going with
          my pet, I got to learn so many amazing things, interacted with so many
          people. I always found everyone to be very helpful and keen to make
          animals life more happier.
